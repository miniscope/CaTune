# Changelog

Repo-level changelog for the CaLab monorepo. Uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.
Versions correspond to git tags (`v*`) and apply to the entire monorepo.

## [2.6.0]

> Unreleased. Covers every change since `v2.5.0` (PR #168).

### Added

- **CaDecon** noise-constrained sparsity — an optional `noise_constrained`
  spike-inference mode that picks the binarization threshold as the sparsest
  spike support whose residual still reaches the data-derived noise floor,
  instead of the fit-maximizing threshold. Knob-free and off by default;
  suppresses spurious low-SNR spikes. Exposed through the WASM solver, the
  CaDecon UI, and the `calab.solve_trace` Python binding (PR #168)
- **CaDecon** calibrated continuous rate — when `mass_count` is on, `solve_trace`
  additionally returns `s_rate`, a graded firing-rate estimate on the correct absolute
  scale (the relaxed solution scaled by the single-spike mass and gated by realness).
  Unlike the integer `s_counts`, it preserves the smoothed rate envelope, so it matches
  the uncorrected bin-sum's correlation-based recovery while also being correctly scaled. 
  Exposed via the WASM solver result and the `calab.solve_trace` Python binding; 
  empty unless `mass_count=True`
- **CaDecon** mass-based count readout — an optional `mass_count` mode that
  counts each contiguous event by its deconvolved mass (calibrated to the
  single-spike mass) and refits alpha, replacing the per-bin binarize→bin-sum.
  Corrects the coherent-grid spike overcount that inflates counts and halves
  alpha at high upsampling, while preserving multiplicity for temporally
  resolvable bursts. Knob-free and off by default; exposed through the WASM
  solver, the CaDecon UI, the bridge config, and the `calab.solve_trace` /
  `calab.decon` Python bindings. 

## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-08

> Covers PRs #153–#167 (all merged 2026-07-08).

### Added

- **CaDecon** bi-exponential fit outcome surfaced as `FitMode`
  (`TwoComponent` / `SlowOnly` / `Degenerate` / `Empty`) on the kernel result;
  Python `fit_biexponential` now returns an 8-tuple (trailing `fit_mode` string)
  and `BiexpFitResult` gained a `fit_mode` field; KernelDisplay warns when
  subset fits are degenerate (PR #162)
- **CaDecon** convergence redesign — converge in kernel **shape space** (peak
  time + FWHM asymptote) with median-tail kernel selection and both filters on
  by default (PR #154), plus an **asymptote dashboard** charting the four
  convergence signals (PR #155)
- Shared uPlot chart primitives in `@calab/ui/chart` — colorblind-safe
  Okabe-Ito palette (`TRACE_COLORS`, `GROUND_TRUTH_COLORS`, `KERNEL_FIT_COLORS`,
  `METRIC_COLORS`, `subsetColor`), viridis colormap (`VIRIDIS_LUT`,
  `viridisRGB`/`viridisCss`), tick math (`niceTicks`), and axis/cursor/range
  helpers (`chartAxis`, `labeledAxis`, `syncCursor`, `safeRange`) (PRs #158, #159, #160)

### Changed

- **CaDecon** raster overview uses the shared viridis colormap and drops the
  intensity colorbar (activity is assumed to span 0→full; absolute values are
  not meaningful) (PR #159)
- `calab-solver` tuning-constant hygiene: introduced `SeedConfig`, shared
  `baseline::DEFAULT_BASELINE_QUANTILE`, and a named `BASELINE_EMA_WEIGHT`;
  deduplicated the bi-exponential fast-component grid bounds so the grid search
  and golden-section refinement cannot drift (no behavior change) (PR #163)
- Tooling: ignore local Python virtualenvs `.venv*/` (PR #156)
- Documentation: reconciled repo docs with the CaDecon review series (PR #164),
  aligned the CaDecon tutorials with it (PR #165), and backfilled the changelog
  from git history (PR #167)

### Fixed

- `calab-solver` FFI boundaries (WASM and PyO3) reject non-finite (NaN/Inf)
  input traces with an explicit error instead of returning garbage results
  (PR #161)
- Solver: banded AR(2) forward model aligned via a one-sample source delay so
  the reconvolution matches the double-exponential kernel (PR #157)
- CaDecon: correct per-subset kernel attribution + init/variance robustness
  (PR #153)

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-20

> Covers the entire 2.4.x line (PRs #99–#152). Reconstructed from git history;
> closely-related PRs are consolidated into single bullets for readability.

### Added

  progress, and auto-export (PRs #108, #109); headless-browser batch mode +
  InDeCa PyO3 bindings (PR #110)
- Shared Rust **simulation module** producing synthetic ground-truth traces,
  exposed to both Python and WASM (PR #113)

  fast component in the bi-exponential fit (PR #105); a `skip` parameter for
  bi-exponential fitting (PR #99)
- Migrated the kernel parameterization from (tau_rise, tau_decay) to
  (t_peak, FWHM) (PR #104)
- CaDecon tutorial set (PR #151)

  and internalize test-only surface (PR #125); bump GHA for Node 24 and clear
  reactivity lint (PR #133); gitignore the whole `.claude/` directory (PR #135)
- CI: Rust + Python lint/type jobs, a build matrix, and SHA-pinned actions
  (PR #124)
- Tests: smoke / export-roundtrip / sub-frame-timing / warm-start quick-wins
  (PR #127); CaDecon iteration-manager state transitions (PR #128); iteration-
  store & multi-cell-store reactivity (PR #129); geo-session edge function +
  RLS policy matrix (PR #130); bridge timeout & mid-run crash detection (PR #131)
- Documentation: separated CaTune and CaDecon into dedicated guides (PR #117);
  promoted CaDecon to stable + root README update (PR #118); reviewed/improved
  all Python docs (PR #116)

### Fixed

- Address pre-merge audit findings — WASM drift, RLS PII, FFI panics, config,
  tests (PR #150)
- Solver: corrected a binning-induced time offset in iterative kernel fitting
  (PR #102); golden-section refinement bug fix (PR #147)
- CaTune: GT marker alignment + spectrum/zoom-window perf sweep (PR #142);
  repair tutorial highlighting after the Peak/FWHM migration (PR #143)
- Headless: prevent resource leaks on browser start/close failures (PR #121)
- Logic + UX polish — tau constraints, bridge errors, reactivity (PR #126)
- Community: show bridge/training submissions and hide demo presets under
  User data (PR #152)
- CI deploy: bump the install-action pin to fix a wasm-pack 404 (PR #148)
