        '<b>‖F − k∗s‖² + λ‖s‖₁</b><br><br>' +
        'The first term measures <b>fit quality</b> (how well the model matches the data). The second term enforces <b>sparsity</b> (prefer fewer, cleaner events). The parameter <b>λ</b> controls the balance between them.',

      title: 'How the Solver Works',

        'CaTune uses <b>FISTA</b> (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm), a proximal gradient method. Each iteration:<br><br>' +
        '<b>1. Gradient step</b> — move toward a better fit to the data<br>' +
        '<b>2. Soft-thresholding</b> — shrink small values to zero, enforcing sparsity<br>' +
        '<b>3. Momentum</b> — Nesterov acceleration for faster convergence<br><br>' +
        'The solver runs in a <b>Rust/WASM Web Worker</b> until the solution stabilizes or hits the iteration limit. Warm-start caching means small parameter changes converge faster than starting from scratch.',
    },
    // Step 6: What decay time really controls
    {
      title: 'What Decay Time Really Controls',
      description:
        '<b>Decay time (τ_decay)</b> sets how quickly the kernel returns to baseline.<br><br>' +
        'When τ_decay <b>matches</b> the true indicator dynamics, the solver cleanly separates individual events — each transient is explained by a brief burst of activity at the onset.<br><br>' +
        'When τ_decay is <b>too short</b>, the kernel decays faster than the real signal. The solver must <b>produce extra activity during the decay phase</b> to explain the lingering fluorescence. This creates artificial activity spread across the tail of each transient.',
      onPopoverRender: renderDecayComparison,
    },
    // Step 7: The delta function trap
    {
      title: 'The Delta Function Trap',
      description:
        'A critical insight: making the kernel <b>sharper and faster</b> will almost always <b>improve the solver\'s fit</b> (lower residuals, higher R²).<br><br>' +
        'As the kernel approaches a delta function, the deconvolved trace simply <b>mirrors the calcium dynamics</b> — including the full rise and decay tail. The fit looks great, but the result is meaningless.<br><br>' +
        'This is the trap <b>automated parameter optimization</b> falls into: it converges on kernels that are much too fast because the fit metric keeps improving. This is why CaTune does not auto-optimize kernel parameters.',
      onPopoverRender: renderDeltaTrap,
    },
    // Step 8: Why sparsity doesn't fix it
    {
      title: "Why Sparsity Doesn't Fix It",
      description:
        'When the deconvolved trace looks too dense with a fast kernel, the instinct is to <b>increase λ</b> (sparsity penalty) to force fewer events.<br><br>' +
        'This <b>masks the symptom</b> but doesn\'t fix the cause — the kernel shape is wrong. High λ with a too-fast kernel produces sparse but <b>arbitrarily-placed</b> events.<br><br>' +
        'The correct fix is always to <b>adjust the kernel</b> (primarily decay time) until deconvolved events align with the rise phase of calcium transients — not to compensate with sparsity.',

      title: 'Reading the Signs',

        'How to tell if your kernel is <b>too fast</b>:<br><br>' +
        '<b>1.</b> Deconvolved events (green) appear spread across the <b>entire duration</b> of calcium transients, not concentrated at the rise<br>' +
        '<b>2.</b> Residuals (red) are <b>suspiciously low</b> — near-zero residuals mean the model is fitting noise, not just signal<br>' +
        '<b>3.</b> The deconvolved trace <b>mirrors the shape</b> of the raw fluorescence<br><br>' +

      title: 'The Role of Noise Filtering',

        'High-frequency noise creates <b>spurious transients</b> in the deconvolved trace. The <b>Noise Filter</b> applies a bandpass derived from your kernel parameters:<br><br>' +
        '• The <b>high-pass</b> removes slow drift (baseline)<br>' +
        '• The <b>low-pass</b> removes noise above what your calcium dynamics can produce<br><br>' +
        'Filtering is conservative — it won\'t change transient shapes — but it significantly cleans up the deconvolution.',
    },
    // Step 11: What deconvolved activity is
    {
      title: 'What Deconvolved Activity Is',
      description:
        'The deconvolved trace <b>s(t)</b> is, at best, a measure of underlying neural activity <b>scaled by an unknown factor</b>. The variable name <b>s</b> is a convention from the optimization literature — it does <b>not</b> stand for "spikes." The output is a continuous, graded signal, not a series of discrete events.<br><br>' +
        'The absolute amplitude of s(t) depends on indicator expression, imaging conditions, cell depth, and many other variables. It has <b>no fixed physical meaning</b>. Only <b>relative differences</b> within the same cell under the same conditions are meaningful.',

    {
      title: 'What Deconvolved Activity Is NOT',
      description:
        'Critical limitations:<br><br>' +
        '<b>1.</b> s(t) is <b>not a spike train</b> — do not threshold it into binary events<br>' +
        '<b>2.</b> You cannot derive <b>spikes-per-second</b> or firing rates from it<br>' +
        '<b>3.</b> It assumes neural activity is within the <b>linear response range</b> of the indicator<br>' +
        '<b>4.</b> It assumes calcium dynamics are not significantly driven by <b>non-neural factors</b> (glial activity, neuromodulation)<br>' +
        '<b>5.</b> It assumes a <b>single uniform kernel</b> applies to all events in the cell<br><br>' +
        'Treat s(t) as a <b>continuous, relative measure</b> of activity — not a direct readout of spiking.',

      description:
        'Given these constraints:<br><br>' +
        '<b>1.</b> Use deconvolved traces for <b>relative comparisons</b> — event timing, relative amplitude changes, correlation between cells<br>' +
        '<b>2.</b> Report your <b>kernel parameters and CaTune version</b> in publications<br>' +
        '<b>3.</b> Check the <b>Community Parameters</b> tab for values others use with your indicator and brain region<br>' +
