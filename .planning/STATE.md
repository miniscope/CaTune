# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Neuroscientists can interactively tune deconvolution parameters on their own calcium imaging data, see immediate visual feedback of fit quality, and learn the tuning workflow through progressive guided tutorials -- all in the browser with zero setup.
**Current focus:** Phase 7 in progress — Community Database

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 8 (Community Database)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Complete (human verification pending for 07-04 Task 2)
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- 07-04 App integration and deploy pipeline complete.

Progress: [██████████] 4/4 Phase 7

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 21
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 72 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-data-foundation | 3/3 | 8 min | 3 min |
| 02-wasm-solver | 3/3 | 22 min | 7 min |
| 03-visualization | 2/2 | 8 min | 4 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Custom ISTA solver in Rust over OSQP-WASM (per research recommendation)
- [Roadmap]: Transferable ArrayBuffer ping-pong for worker communication (GitHub Pages cannot serve COOP/COEP headers for SharedArrayBuffer)
- [Roadmap]: Phases 2 (solver) and 3 (visualization) can develop in parallel
- [01-01]: Manual project scaffold instead of npm init solid for precise Vite 7 version control
- [01-01]: Individual SolidJS signals (createSignal) instead of createStore for linear import flow
- [01-01]: jsdom added as devDependency for Vitest DOM test environment
- [01-02]: Zero-copy typed array view with copy fallback for unaligned offsets
- [01-02]: Regex header parsing for .npy Python dict literals (no eval/Function)
- [01-02]: Big-endian rejection with helpful message rather than byte-swapping
- [01-02]: Negative values tracked in stats but no warning (deltaF/F can be negative)
- [02-01]: DFT-based Lipschitz constant instead of sum-of-squares (operator norm, not Frobenius norm)
- [02-01]: FISTA with adaptive restart (O'Donoghue & Candes 2015) to prevent oscillation with non-negativity
- [02-01]: Two-sequence FISTA formulation (x_k proximal, y_k extrapolated) for correct convergence
- [02-01]: Homebrew gcc-15 as C linker for Rust native tests (WSL2 lacks build-essential)
- [02-02]: Disabled wasm-opt (bundled version incompatible with Rust 1.93 bulk-memory ops)
- [02-02]: LIBRARY_PATH env var for wasm-pack host-target build script compilation
- [02-02]: Worker singleton pattern (create once, never terminate) for WASM instance reuse
- [02-03]: 5*tauDecay*fs padding for overlap-and-discard windowing (research Pattern 3)
- [02-03]: 20% relative threshold for tau change warm-start classification (research Pattern 4)
- [02-03]: 30ms debounce for rapid slider movements; stale job discard via counter
- [02-03]: Copy trace subarray before transfer to avoid detaching parent Float64Array
- [03-01]: Left-click drag for pan, scroll-wheel for zoom (oscilloscope model per research)
- [03-01]: X-axis only zoom with y auto-range (scientific trace viewing standard)
- [03-01]: Disabled uPlot default box-select zoom in favor of drag-to-pan
- [03-01]: autoResize enabled on SolidUplot for responsive width filling
- [03-02]: Visualization store decoupled from solver for reactive data flow
- [03-02]: Mock trace generator creates synthetic data for development (Phase 4 replaces with real solver output)
- [03-02]: Raw + reconvolution fit combined in single panel as multi-series overlay
- [03-02]: Residual trace derived as createMemo for automatic reactivity
- [04-01]: Local lambda signal in ParameterPanel (not viz-store) to avoid modifying shared state before Plan 03 integration
- [04-01]: Local solverStatus signal in ConvergenceIndicator -- Plan 03 will move both to viz-store
- [04-01]: onInput for live solver feedback, onChange for undo history commits (one undo entry per drag gesture)
- [04-02]: Conditional base path via GITHUB_ACTIONS env var (auto-set by runner, no manual config)
- [04-02]: Artifact-based Pages deployment (upload-pages-artifact + deploy-pages) over gh-pages branch approach
- [04-03]: Copy Float64Arrays from solver results with new Float64Array() to avoid ArrayBuffer detachment
- [04-03]: Guard flag pattern (isUndoRedoInProgress) prevents undo/redo from pushing to history
- [04-03]: Solve full trace on initial load (visibleStart=0, visibleEnd=trace.length)
- [04-03]: 30ms debounce via SolverJobScheduler for rapid slider movements
- [05-01]: Single-pass variance (sumSq/n - mean^2) for O(cells*timepoints) activity ranking
- [05-01]: Cold start for batch solves (no warm-start reuse across different cells)
- [05-01]: Sequential batch solve to avoid worker contention with interactive tuning
- [05-02]: Direct port of Rust tau_to_ar2 preserving variable names (d, r, g1, g2) for cross-language consistency
- [05-02]: Schema version 1.0.0 with metadata fields for Phase 7/8 forward compatibility
- [05-02]: Auto-clear pinned snapshot on cell switch (research Pitfall 4)
- [05-03]: Batch solve triggers on parameter commit (onChange) only, not on slider drag (onInput)
- [05-03]: Separate uPlot sync group 'catune-multi' for mini-panels
- [05-03]: Cell indices displayed 1-indexed in UI, 0-indexed internally
- [05-03]: 100ms setTimeout before initial batch solve to let primary cell solve first

- [06-01]: Interactive step blocking via tutorialActionFired signal + onNextClick override
- [06-01]: notifyTutorialAction auto-advances tour after user performs required action
- [06-02]: data-tutorial prop added to ParameterSlider interface for passthrough (slider-rise, slider-decay, slider-lambda)
- [06-02]: Unicode escape sequences for em-dashes and smart quotes in tutorial content (portable)
- [06-02]: Interactive workflow steps use waitForAction='slider-change' with disableActiveInteraction=false
- [06-03]: Tutorial panel state managed locally in App.tsx (not global store) for UI-only concern
- [06-03]: First-time banner checks localStorage and data-loaded state before showing
- [06-03]: createEffect auto-closes tutorial panel when tour becomes active for cleaner UX
- [06-03]: Tuning orchestrator conditionally calls notifyTutorialAction only when tutorial is active
- [07-01]: Supabase client exports null (not throws) when credentials missing for graceful degradation
- [07-01]: vite-env.d.ts added for Vite client type declarations (import.meta.env support)
- [07-01]: ArrayBuffer.slice() copy in dataset-hash for strict BufferSource type compatibility
- [07-01]: signOut scope: 'local' for single-tab logout per Supabase best practice
- [07-01]: redirectTo uses window.location.origin + BASE_URL for GitHub Pages subpath compatibility
- [07-02]: SubmitPanel replaces ExportPanel as the single unified action point per locked decision
- [07-02]: Datalist inputs (not select dropdowns) for indicator, species, brain region to allow custom values
- [07-02]: Metadata form gated behind user() check -- AuthGate renders first, form fields only when authenticated
- [07-02]: community.css overwrites previous placeholder styles with complete auth + submission styling
- [07-03]: Raw uPlot instance via createEffect instead of SolidUplot wrapper (mode:2 data format incompatible)
- [07-03]: Client-side filtering of full dataset instead of re-fetching on filter change
- [07-03]: CSS transform rotate for vertical marginal histogram orientation
- [07-04]: CommunityBrowser placed after viz-container, guarded by supabaseEnabled Show block
