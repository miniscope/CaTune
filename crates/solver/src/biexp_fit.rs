/// Two-component bi-exponential fitting: extract tau_rise and tau_decay from a free-form kernel.
///
/// # Physical motivation
///
/// Iterative deconvolution alternates between two steps:
///   1. **Spike solve**: given a kernel K, find spikes s that explain the trace y ≈ K*s + b
///   2. **Kernel solve**: given spikes s, re-estimate the free-form kernel h_free
///
/// The spike solver detects events by correlating the trace with the current kernel.
/// Where noise happens to correlate with the kernel's rising edge (bins 1-3), the
/// solver produces false-positive spikes. When these spurious spikes are fed back
/// into kernel estimation, they imprint an artifact onto h_free whose shape is
/// determined by the noise autocorrelation structure, not the calcium kernel's
/// time constants.
///
/// A single biexponential fit would try to explain both the true calcium kernel and
/// this artifact with one curve, causing tau_rise to collapse toward zero. The
/// two-component model explicitly separates them.
///
/// # Model
///
/// Fits h(t) = beta_s * T_s(t) + beta_f * T_f(t)
/// where:
/// - **Slow component** (calcium kernel): T_s(t) = exp(-t/tau_d) - exp(-t/tau_r)
/// - **Fast component** (noise artifact):  T_f(t) = exp(-t/tau_d_fast) - exp(-t/tau_r_fast)
///
/// The fast component has independent time constants (tau_r_fast, tau_d_fast),
/// decoupled from the slow component. This avoids the oscillation problem that
/// occurred when the fast component was parameterized as a uniform time-scaling
/// of the slow component (tau_r*r, tau_d*r) — with large tau_d the fast template's
/// decay would extend too far, overlapping the calcium rise.
///
/// Both components are 0 at t=0 by the biexponential identity (exp(0)-exp(0)=0),
/// so no skip or null hacks are needed at bin 0.
///
/// When no artifact exists, beta_f converges to ~0, recovering the single-biexp result.
///
/// Uses grid search over (tau_r, tau_d, tau_r_fast, tau_d_fast) with 2-variable NNLS
/// for (beta_s, beta_f), optionally refined by golden-section search. Supports warm-
/// starting from a previous result.
///
/// # Sequential-ceiling on the fast component
///
/// In the iterative deconvolution loop, the slow component's tau_rise starts
/// too high and gradually converges to the true value.  While it is still
/// converging, the slow template under-predicts the kernel's rise, leaving
/// a residual that the fast template can absorb.  Because the joint NNLS
/// optimizes both amplitudes simultaneously, the fast component can "steal"
/// slow-component amplitude — the overall fit improves on the current
/// (still-evolving) kernel, but both components drift from their true values.
///
/// To prevent this we compute a **sequential estimate** of beta_f at each
/// grid point: first fit the slow component alone (beta_s = <h, T_s> / <T_s, T_s>),
/// then fit the fast component to the slow residual:
///
///   bf_seq = max(0,  (<h, T_f> − beta_s · <T_s, T_f>) / <T_f, T_f>)
///
/// This gives the fast component's amplitude if it could only explain what
/// the slow template at this grid point leaves behind — it cannot steal
/// slow amplitude.  The joint NNLS is then gated with  bf ≤ bf_seq × HEADROOM,
/// which lets the joint solve redistribute some amplitude (essential — the
/// fast component must absorb the artifact so the slow component doesn't
/// distort) while preventing unbounded redistribution.
///
/// Key properties:
///   • Self-contained: computed from the same inner products already
///     available inside eval_two_component — zero extra O(n) work.
///   • Self-calibrating: large artifact → large residual → generous ceiling.
///   • Physically motivated: the fast component picks up features that
///     the slow component at this (tau_r, tau_d) genuinely cannot explain.
///   • No external state: works identically on iteration 1 and iteration N,
///     no dependence on warm-start or previous iteration history.
///
/// **Design decision — the ceiling is retained.**  The fast grid ranges were
/// since tightened (tau_r_fast ≤ 2×dt, tau_d_fast ≤ min(8×dt, tau_d×0.15),
/// sub-sample floors), which addresses the *original* trigger of slow/fast
/// mixing: fast grid floors that were too high (tau_r_fast ≥ dt,
/// tau_d_fast ≥ 2×dt) left almost no search range at low sampling rates and
/// forced wide fast templates overlapping the slow component.  Even so, the
/// sequential ceiling is kept as defence in depth rather than reverted to a
/// plain `bs >= bf` gate: it is O(1) (reuses inner products already computed),
/// self-calibrating (large artifact → generous ceiling), and independent of
/// the grid — so it still bounds redistribution for any (tau_r, tau_d) the
/// joint NNLS reaches, including warm-started points outside the cold grid.
/// The two guards are complementary, and the cost of keeping both is nil.

/// Explicit outcome of a bi-exponential fit, so a degenerate / fallback fit is
/// reported rather than silently inferred by the caller from `beta_fast == 0`.
