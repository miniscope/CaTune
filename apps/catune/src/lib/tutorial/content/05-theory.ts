        'When \u03C4_decay <b>matches</b> the true indicator dynamics, the solver cleanly separates individual events — each transient is explained by a brief burst of activity at the onset.<br><br>' +
        'When \u03C4_decay is <b>too short</b>, the kernel decays faster than the real signal. The solver must <b>produce extra activity during the decay phase</b> to explain the lingering fluorescence. This creates artificial activity spread across the tail of each transient.',

        'This is the trap <b>automated parameter optimization</b> falls into: it converges on kernels that are much too fast because the fit metric keeps improving. This is why CaTune does not auto-optimize kernel parameters.<br><br>' +
        'The instinct is to <b>increase \u03BB</b> (sparsity) to compensate for the dense activity, but this <b>masks the symptom</b> without fixing the cause — the kernel shape is wrong. High \u03BB with a too-fast kernel produces sparse but arbitrarily-placed events. The correct fix is always to <b>adjust the kernel</b> (primarily decay time).',

        '<b>2. Bandpass filter</b> (Noise Filter toggle) \u2014 the high-pass removes slow oscillations the baseline subtraction may miss; the low-pass removes noise above what your calcium dynamics can produce.<br>' +
        '<b>3. Solver baseline estimate</b> \u2014 if neither of the above fully removes the baseline, the solver estimates a scalar baseline offset during iteration.<br><br>' +

Even with normalization, extreme caution is needed — clever normalization schemes can help but are very limited and cannot fully resolve the unknown scaling differences.<br><br>' +
        'The deconvolved output should never be treated as "spikes." Researchers often threshold out of habit from electrophysiology, but calcium deconvolution is <b>fundamentally different</b>: the temporal resolution and signal characteristics make binary discretization inappropriate.
