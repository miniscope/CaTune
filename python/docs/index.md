# CaLab

**Calcium imaging analysis tools — deconvolution and data preparation.**

Calcium imaging captures neural activity as fluorescence traces, but the
raw signal is a blurred, noisy proxy for the underlying spiking activity.
_Deconvolution_ recovers a sharp estimate of that activity from the slow
calcium indicator dynamics. CaLab makes this step fast and tunable: a
compiled Rust FISTA solver runs the math, an interactive browser UI lets
you dial in the parameters on real data, and Python utilities handle the
rest — loading traces from CaImAn or Minian, batch processing, and
exporting results.

CaLab provides two deconvolution approaches:

- **CaTune** — interactive parameter tuning in the browser, then batch deconvolution with those parameters
- **CaDecon** — automated deconvolution that estimates parameters from your data
