# @calab/cala-runtime

Browser-side orchestration primitives for the CaLa streaming demixing
pipeline. Workers (decoder, fit, extend, archive) import channel and
protocol types from here; numerics live in `@calab/core` (and the
`cala-core` WASM build).

Reference: `.planning/CALA_DESIGN.md §7` — worker topology, channel
design, mutation queue protocol, asset snapshot protocol.

## Module map

- `channel.ts` — SAB-backed single-producer/single-consumer ring for
  frame data (decoder → fit, fit → extend). [landed, task 15]
- `mutation-queue.ts` — bounded drop-oldest ring (extend → fit).
  [later task 16]
- `asset-snapshot.ts` — copy-on-write snapshot of `A, W, M` at an
  epoch boundary. [later task 17]
- `events.ts` — event bus consumed by the archive worker.
  [later task 17]
- `orchestrator.ts` — spawns workers, wires channels, tracks epochs,
  owns two-pass toggle. [later task 18]
